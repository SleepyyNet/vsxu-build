zlib:
1. 
- copy win32/Makefile.gcc into the source directory
- edit it to set prefix and PREFIX (install dir / compiler prefix) correctly
- make install
2. in the installed dir, comment out the ZLIB_DLL part in the zconf.h since we couldn't build that anyway.

glfw:
TARGET=i686-w64-mingw32- PREFIX=/home/jaw/vsxu/build/win32/dependencies-install make cross-mgw-install

glew:
GLEW_DEST=/home/jaw/vsxu/build/win32/dependencies-install make SYSTEM=linux-i686-w64-mingw32 install

jpeg:
./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --prefix=/home/jaw/vsxu/build/win32/dependencies-install
make
make install

png: 
  cd png
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/home/jaw/vsxu/build/win32/cmake/Toolchain-mingw32.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/jaw/vsxu/build/win32/dependencies-install ..
  make

pthreads:
  - edit the pthread.h and comment out the struct_timespec struct.
  make -f GNUmakefile CROSS=i686-w64-mingw32- GC-inlined
  
  GNUmakefile has no install target; copy the following files:
  pthreadGC2.dll -> bin
  libpthreadGC2.a -> lib
  pthread.h -> include
  sched.h -> include
  semaphore.h -> include


After this is done, get into the lib dir of the install directory and remove all .dll.a and dll's
to avoid find_package from finding the dll versions. We're aiming at a static linkage.
